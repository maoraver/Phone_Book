## Phone Book project - Storing Contact Details
This project was made as part of my studies as an Practical Software Engineer.
In this project we build a sample forms to store contact details that you choose. This project was created using Visual Studio Code.
There is no DB in this proj, and every time you will restart your browser it will show 4 specific contacts.

## To Be Honest
Like I said before - this project was made as part of my studies.
As Practical Software Engineer, I was learned only the base of React and tried to do my best.
Yes, I'm sure that I can make it better, and I promise I will work hard to create bigger project than this.
It was just important to me to show you guys some of my projects I did as part of my studies.
Hope you will enjoy it - and I want to know every single thing that you think I can to improve in this project.
